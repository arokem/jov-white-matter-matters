    "\n",
    "Diffusion MRI is a non-invasive method to measure the location- and direction-specific diffusion of water in the human brain *in vivo*. The measurement is rendered sensitive to diffusion through an application of a pulsed gradient, which is why the experiment is sometimes described as a Pulsed-Gradient Spin-Echo (or PGSE) experiment. Between the two gradients, a diffusion time is set, allowing water molecules to diffuse. The experiment is usually described through a diffusion sensitization parameter, called the b-value (possibly because it was first calculated by the French MRI scientist Denis Le-Bihan). This parameter summarizes several parameters of the measurement:\n",
